      "content": "Founded in 2020, Safik AI emerged from a simple observation: while AI technology was advancing rapidly, most organizations struggled to implement it effectively. Our founders, a team of former Google and Microsoft AI researchers, set out to bridge this gap. Today, we're a team of 45 AI specialists serving clients across healthcare, finance, retail, and technology sectors. We've processed over 10 billion data points, deployed 200+ AI models in production, and helped our clients achieve an average of 35% operational efficiency improvements."
